# -Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project-Hotel-Bookings-Dataset


Project Overview:

This project analyzes hotel booking data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover key insights. The goal is to understand booking trends, cancellations, customer behavior, revenue patterns, and geographical distribution of guests. By identifying peak seasons, cancellation reasons, and pricing impacts, this EDA helps hotels optimize their strategies for better revenue management and customer satisfaction.


Goals of the Project:

1.  Understand Booking Trends – Analyze booking patterns across different months and hotel types.
2.  Identify Cancellation Factors – Examine reasons and trends in reservation cancellations.
3.  Revenue Analysis – Study the impact of cancellations and booking rates on revenue.
4.  Customer Segmentation – Identify key customer groups based on demographics and booking behavior.
5.  Market Segment Insights – Evaluate the distribution of customers across different market segments.
5.  Geographical Distribution – Analyze the origin of guests and their booking preferences.
6.  Impact of Price on Bookings – Investigate how the Average Daily Rate (ADR) affects reservation and cancellation rates.
7.  Seasonal Trends – Detect peak and low booking periods for better planning and revenue management.
8.  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, remove outliers, and structure the dataset for better analysis.
9.  Visual Insights – Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that make data-driven insights easier to interpret.
